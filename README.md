# Udacity iOS Developer Nanodegree - PitchPerfect App
This repository contains the PitchPerfect app from Udacity's Intro to iOS App Development with Swift course. This app leverages 
Model View Controller (MVC) design principles, using custom model code, UIViewController, and UIView.

## Overview
PitchPerfect allows users to record their voice and play back the recording using different modulations to change the playback. 
The user can choose between 6 different modulation effects: a fast playback rate, a slow playback rate, a high pitch, a low pitch, an echo,
and a reverb.
